This is a simple application developed using nodejs,expressjs as a platform and mongoDb as a database
which will give an understanding of the total amount to be paid by the employee of the company along with 5% interest on a flat loan of at most 100000.
   
 Steps to run the application
 1. clone the repository using $git clone 'repo name'
 2. Install the dependencies using npm install
 3. Here i am using my Cloud mongoDb database which is Mlab so you can directly work with this by changing mongoDb connection to your local mongoDb database or you can create your own database account in mlab and give your username and password in mongoDb connection in app.js file
 4. Now run the application using $npm start or $node app.js commands.

 Give your estimated loan amount in the form provided and it will show you how much total amount to be paid after one year including the interest of 5%.
